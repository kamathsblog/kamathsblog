This week, I was supposed to be implementing the [Parameter Server on micro-ROS](https://micro.ros.org/docs/tutorials/programming_rcl_rclc/parameters/), but I decided to put that aside for a while and work on updating the [robot description](https://github.com/adityakamath/akros/tree/main/akros_description) instead. I made [some hardware changes](https://adityakamath.github.io/2022-08-05-akros2-firmware-part-3/) since moving to ROS 2 (new RPi 4 case, changed LIDAR position) a while ago, but never got the chance to update the robot description files. I divided this into four steps:

1. Update the [akros\_description package](https://github.com/adityakamath/akros/tree/main/akros_description), which is still using [ROS 1 Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic)
    
2. Update the [URDF](https://github.com/adityakamath/akros/blob/main/akros_description/urdf/akros.urdf.xacro) and [meshes](https://github.com/adityakamath/akros_3d_assets/tree/akros) to reflect the hardware changes
    
3. Update the [mesh publisher](https://github.com/adityakamath/akros/blob/main/akros_description/scripts/mesh_publisher.py), which publishes URDF mesh elements as a [MarkerArray](http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/visualization_msgs/html/msg/MarkerArray.html) for remote visualization, using [Foxglove Studio](https://foxglove.dev/studio) for example
    
4. Move the [ROS 1 launch file](https://github.com/adityakamath/akros/blob/main/akros_description/launch/akros_description.launch) to a python launch file for ROS 2, and include it in [akros2\_bringup\_launch.py](https://github.com/adityakamath/akros2_bringup/blob/humble/launch/akros2_bringup_launch.py)
    

I started by creating a new [akros2\_description](https://github.com/adityakamath/akros2_description/tree/humble) package in [ROS 2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) and setting up the [updated URDF](https://github.com/adityakamath/akros2_description/blob/humble/urdf/akros2.urdf). I already had the URDF from before the hardware changes, so I only had to [update the meshes](https://github.com/adityakamath/akros_3d_assets/tree/akros2) and change the positions of the links in the URDF file.

I did have some trouble with the [realsense\_ros library for ROS 2](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros), while setting up the [T265 tracking camera](https://www.intelrealsense.com/tracking-camera-t265/). Earlier versions (with ROS 1) allowed me to do the following things:

* Provide wheel odometry to the T265 (using a calibration JSON file) and get the fused `odom_frame->base_link` transform.
    
* OR disable the odometry transform (instead publish odometry messages), and use an [Extended Kalman Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Kalman_filter) (EKF, using [robot\_localization](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/robot_localization/html/index.html#)) on ROS 1 to fuse the T265 and wheel odometry messages. This EKF node then provided the `odom_frame->base_link` transform.
    

However, both these features (previously set as launch arguments from the launch file / CLI) are now deprecated in the [latest ROS 2 release](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros/releases/tag/4.51.1). Intel doesn't plan on supporting it either, especially since the hardware has been discontinued. As a result, I now have the following in ROS 2:

* T265 provides the `odom_frame->base_link` transform directly using [visual-inertial odometry (VIO)](https://www.intelrealsense.com/visual-inertial-tracking-case-study/) and does not include wheel odometry.
    
* Wheel odometry is provided by the [micro-ROS node](https://github.com/adityakamath/akros2_firmware), and is linked to `enc_odom_frame` (as the parent link), with `base_footprint` as the default child link.
    

Going forward, I still need to figure out how I can fuse them both - either I update realsense\_ros by myself to include wheel odometry using a launch argument, or I run an EKF node but I'm unsure how the transform tree will look now that I cannot disable the odometry transform from the T265.

## Mesh Publisher

For now, everything worked as expected, so I decided to work on the [mesh publisher](https://github.com/adityakamath/akros2_description/blob/humble/akros2_description/mesh_publisher.py). When working remotely with ROS 2 running on the robot and Foxglove Studio running on my Windows laptop (without ROS 2 installed), I can visualize all topics and transforms, but not URDFs. So, I created a [MarkerArray publisher](https://github.com/adityakamath/akros/blob/main/akros_description/scripts/mesh_publisher.py), that publishes the meshes of the robot's components as an array of markers, with each mesh linked to its respective URDF link. But this was done a while ago and was still using ROS 1 Noetic. However, migrating to ROS 2 was straightforward.

When I first ran the mesh publisher, I connected a monitor to my RPi to visualize it on RViz2. The marker array transforms looked fine (although it seems RViz2 does not like transparent markers), as seen in the image below.

But the meshes were all rotated when I tried visualizing it on Foxglove, as seen in the image below.

I struggled with this for a while, before realizing that meshes in the 3D panel default to the y-up orientation, while [ROS (and my design) uses the z-up orientation](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html).

After changing the default orientation in the 3D panel settings, and a quick restart, the problem was solved.

## Joint State Publisher

While testing my implementation, I ran two other nodes alongside the mesh publisher:

* [robot\_state\_publisher](https://github.com/ros/robot_state_publisher) to view the actual robot description on RViz2. This node also subscribes to the combined [JointState message](https://docs.ros2.org/galactic/api/sensor_msgs/msg/JointState.html), which moves the corresponding joints in the URDF according to the provided velocity and position.
    
* [joint\_state\_publisher](https://github.com/ros/joint_state_publisher) to subscribe to individual joint states (motor states in this case - position, velocity) and publish the combined JointState message to which the robot\_state\_publisher subscribes.
    

Originally, in ROS 1, I was using the mesh publisher node instead of the joint\_state\_publisher to publish the JointState message. The node subscribed to the measured speeds of each motor from the [ROSSerial firmware](https://github.com/adityakamath/arduino_sketchbook_ros/tree/main/akros_holo_drive) and calculated the speed in rad/s and the position in radians for each joint. This was then published as a combined JointState message to robot\_state\_publisher.

In ROS 2, I decided to do this directly from the micro-ROS firmware. So, instead of publishing the measured speeds of each motor, the micro-ROS node would now publish a combined JointState message with the measured speeds and positions of each motor. I made the necessary changes to the micro-ROS firmware, which can be seen [here](https://github.com/adityakamath/akros2_firmware/blob/akros2_humble/akros2_firmware.ino).

I was originally also publishing the required speeds for each motor, so I also changed that to publish another JointState message but with the required speeds and positions of each joint. While it is not used anywhere, it is useful for me as a debugging and controller tuning tool.

## Launch File

Finally, I set up the launch file. I created a launch argument to switch between the micro-ROS node and the joint\_state\_publisher to publish the combined joint states. While I did start by checking out [rosetta\_launch](https://github.com/MetroRobots/rosetta_launch) (an amazing resource about writing ROS 2 launch files), I eventually ended up just asking [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to write it for me. Since ROS and its community-developed resources are open-source and mostly freely available on GitHub, ChatGPT seems to be trained really well to write simple ROS (1, 2, and micro-ROS) code. Once the [akros2\_description launch file](https://github.com/adityakamath/akros2_description/blob/humble/launch/akros2_description_launch.py) was ready, I then updated the [akros2\_bringup launch file](https://github.com/adityakamath/akros2_bringup/blob/humble/launch/akros2_bringup_launch.py) to include the description launch file and set the correct launch arguments. Once ready, I could launch everything (sensors, motor control using micro-ROS, visualization nodes, and the robot description including the mesh publisher) using a single launch file. Here is the resulting visualization on Foxglove Studio:

## Next Up

Next up I want to stick to my earlier plan and set up the [Parameter Server on micro-ROS](https://micro.ros.org/docs/tutorials/programming_rcl_rclc/parameters/). Like I mentioned last time, I also want to explore [tracing for ROS 2](https://github.com/ros2/ros2_tracing) and [micro-ROS](https://micro.ros.org/docs/tutorials/advanced/tracing/). As for [the book for February](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40876575-utopia-for-realists), I was able to finish it (although a few days late). For March, I chose [this book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36062756-science-ish?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_9). And speaking of books, I also received [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Concise-Introduction-Robot-Programming-ROS2/dp/1032264659) by [Francisco Martin Rico](https://twitter.com/Fmrico) during the week:

I skimmed through the chapters, and it seems to have a lot of relevant information despite being so thin (as the title suggests, it is definitely concise). It looks like an amazing resource, that I will be referring to throughout the year...
